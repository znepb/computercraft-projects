# computercraft-projects
Some random ComputerCraft projects.

## discord-bridge
Two programs with Discord <-> Minecraft chat integration.
  
Originally written January of 2021, updated June of 2021.
  
**Requires:** Advanced Peripherals, a discord server, and a bot.

## player-data-rcon-api
A REST api written in JS, that interfaces with a Minecraft server via rcon. Pretty simple and nifty. Might be prone to exploits, if you find any please make an issue, or preferably, contact me [here](https://znepb.me/#contact) so the issue can be discussed in private to prevent any exploits. Note that it is also very unstable and crashes often. ðŸ™‚  
  
Written early June 2021.

**Requires:** Server access, and Javascript

## elevator(%d).lua
Script I wrote to run an elevator I made using Create, Advanced Peripherals and ComputerCraft. v2 is the imporved version and is way more optimized (all-be-it, with less safety features.) I'll make a video showing how to set up the elevator itsself in the future, but there's a demo video on YouTube you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/Wwx5LPin9-g) if you'd like.  
  
v1 and v2 written mid June 2021.
  
**Requires:** Create, Advanced Peripherals *(and some fancy building skills)*

## scanner.lua
Scans the world using a command computer, and outputs to an nfp. Not very fast, probably could be made faster.
  
Written early June 2021.
  
**Requires:** A command computer.

## soda-dispenser.lua
A program I made that displays a fancy UI you can select items from (not just sodas.) You can chuck anything in there if you'd like, although it is pre-programmed to sodas.
